# LeetLog 

This is a Leet log. A log of Leetcode problems and their solutions done by me, </br>
in reverse chronological order. </br>
</br>
* **[2019-03-04]**   [472. Concatenated Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenated-words/) </br>
  Took me long time. Because was implementing trie from scratch, which is a lot of boring work :( 
  In the end, replaced trie with a simple hashmap. Tricks to use: 
  * first, maximally formalize the problem 
  * Second, write the code and tests
  * Third, **do not overoptimize**. Use whatever structures you already have in stdlib. Trie took me ~4 hours 
    to work and pass all tests and still I am not sure whether it is an optimal trie, or there are more 
    tricks to it
